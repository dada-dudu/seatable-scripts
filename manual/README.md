# Introduction

SeaTable scirpts are written in Javascript language. They are designed for you to manipulate data in a base easily. A script can be run in users' browser or in background inside a Docker container. (Currently running in browser is supported yet)

There are some pre-defined objects:

1. base, you can use base object to manipulate data in a base.
2. output, you can use output object to output some feedbacks.

You can find some easy to understand examples here: [https://github.com/seatable/seatable-scripts/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/seatable/seatable-scripts/tree/master/examples)
